# containers

This is a repository with some code I wrote to **learn** more about containers. It currently contains:

- [`yacr`](./yacr/): a container runtime that implements the [runtime-spec][]
- [`yacs`](./yacs/): a container shim with an (HTTP) API

For more information, please refer to the documentation of each sub-project.

Want to give it a quick try? [Open this project in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/willdurand/containers)!
